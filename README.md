# Past-Project-Experience
This repository will include the past projects.

1. Data Mining Project\
The objective is to compare the performance of these three methods, kNN, Na√Øve Bayes and classification trees on the orange juice data. We will try to predict the class of the new data and observe the performances by using techniques that we have learned in data mining class.\

This project is aiming to find which group of age may have a higher likelihood of heart attack using the ANOVA test and identify the new record of patients by using the logistic regression model.\

4. Word Segmentation Project\
AI can not separate many words in long sentences and in other languages
will get more details that AI can not do. Therefore, we will write the code and separate them correctly and save them as a dictionary. However, in this project, the AI can not separate the word by itself but we need to know the basics and understand how it works from the lesson in the classroom.\
